# Hangman Game

## Game Rules

Hangman is a word-guessing game where you try to guess the secret
word letter by letter. Here are the rules:

A random word will be selected for you to guess.

Guess one letter at a time by clicking on the available letters.

If the letter is correct, it will be revealed in the word. If
it's incorrect, part of the hangman will be drawn.

You have a limited number of attempts to guess the word before
the hangman is completed.

If you guess the word correctly, you win the game!
If you run out of attempts, the hangman is completed and you
lose.
